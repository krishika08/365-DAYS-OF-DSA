# 📘 365 Days of DSA (Java)

This repository documents my **365-day Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) journey** using Java.

The goal of this challenge is to build strong fundamentals, problem-solving confidence, and daily discipline — *not speedrunning problems or chasing hype.*

## 🎯 Objectives
- Practice DSA every day for 365 days
- Focus on **understanding before optimization**
- Progress from beginner → intermediate
- Maintain daily GitHub commits
- Build habits required for internship-level preparation

## 🧠 Approach
1. Start with **basic / brute-force solutions** to fully understand logic.
2. Gradually move to **optimized approaches** when concepts are clear.
3. Emphasis on:
   - Clear problem understanding
   - Correct use of constraints
   - Time & space complexity awareness
   - **No skipping fundamentals**
